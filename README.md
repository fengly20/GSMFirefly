A routine I used for monitoring campsite availability in Elkmont Campground, TN. The user will be receiving email notification if any campsite is available during the desired time frame.

Right now a lot of stuff is hard-coded, as it only checks the availability in Fri, Sat, and Sun starting from 06/03. But at least it works. 

I used Gmail API for the email notification part which means user will need his own client_secret.json and have the API swithed on.
